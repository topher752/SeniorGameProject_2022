From William Peace University's Game Design Bachelor progam, SGD 411 is described as "A capstone experience in the 
Simulation and Game Design sequence. In teams, students will work across and outside of typical production roles 
in order to design, prototype, and create a digital game."

Our project brought to you by **Collective Crying**: _Bakesmith_ consisted of making a game with a learning aspect, pre-production of an agreed idea,
a high-concept that fleshes out gameplay mechanics, story, concept art, and roles. This repository not only goes over those documents, but
also includes the visual assets and scripts made over the project. This project included working with the MOCAP System for all of our animations, using Maya,
Blender, Substance Painter, Procreate and Photoshop for all of our art and design assets and using Unity and Visual Studio Code for our main development.
The README file will include links to each document and videos that were created to showcase our process.
